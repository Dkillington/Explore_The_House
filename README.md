# Overview
## Source Code
Hosted here is the source code for the game, however it does not contain audio files as these are far too large for Git. 
Because of this, the game cannot be built - unless custom audio files are added

## Playing The Game
I have already built the game (audio files included) and put it here as "GAME.zip". Extract it and open the .exe to play the game.
